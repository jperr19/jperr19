- Hi, Iâ€™m @jperr19
- A full-time research coordinator currently working at a land grant institution with a newfound love of statistics and data science.
- I have modest coding experience in SAS, R, and Python working primarily with experimental data.
- I am in love with the concept of getting data to tell a story, and wish to one day make a career out of it.
- Follow along as I work on making this dream a reality while the kiddos are asleep. Cheers!
